/**
 * This native library loader loads libraries from jar resources. It resolves the library file extension based on the
 * loading OS automatically. It offers functionality to extract and load libraries. All library files are extracted into
 * the current working directory. This allows the automatic discovery of dependent libraries.
 *
 * Notice: Former versions of this implementation used the trick from the Fahd Shariff's website
 * (http://fahdshariff.blogspot.com/2011/08/changing-java-library-path-at-runtime.html); however, that trick does not
 * work under windows; neither when using System.loadLibrary as described in the blog or System.load.  For this reason
 * I opted to copy the libraries to the current working directory '.' which enables the discovery of dependent
 * libraries automatically.
